This is a repository of scripts used everyday in all of my computers. Most of them are by me, one or two of them are gleaned here and there and modified. Too lazy to source them for now, but I will if asked.

I'll try to document them a bit at some point. They are a jumbled mess of French and English. Deal with it.

The most interresting functions are : 
 - A counter that tracks how much leisure you watch/use and stops you if you don't have any time left
 - Scripts that downloads from youtube and reads the videos in order of publication, then allows you to sort the individual videos however you want
 - A script to add tasks to Amazing Marvin with all the tags and flags I use
 - A script that helps me sort my music in Audacious

Feel free to use them however you want. They might not be very portable as is though.
